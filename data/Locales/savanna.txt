{{NavigationHabitats}}

Savannas are large fields of grass with some trees that are found in hot and dry regions. It is a rare environment in the Monster Hunter series, as only couple areas can be described as savannas, and those environments also tend to have desert areas to them.<!-- I do not think the ancestral steppe should count as a savanna, it is a steppe. so I did not include it (I do think perhaps a grassland environment category would be good to include?)
also FYI the descriptions of the environments are coped and pasted from the desert page. there's not a real reason to write a new description. -->

== [[Sixth Generation]] ==

=== [[Windward Plains]] ===
A vast locale that is both desert and savanna. The locale contains two gigantic open areas, one featuring a savanna environment with yellow grass and trees that has a river flowing through; the other area is a barren stretch of sand dunes. Between the two areas are a number of smaller cave-like zones. The locale also has a giant ring-like structure, and many pillar-like structures that function as lightning rods. Inside of the Windward Plains lies the village of [[Kunafa]], which produces cheese and works with [[Seikret|Seikrets]].

During the Fallow period, the area features a desaturated color palette and yellowed, dehydrated flora. During the Inclemency period, a giant thundering sandstorm sweeps across the area, during which the apex [[Rey Dau]] becomes active. The plains are buffeted by sand and constant lightning strikes. The giant ring-like structure also lights up due to the ore around its base. During the Plenty period, color returns to the plains as the area becomes vibrant and lush.

== [[Third Generation]] ==

=== [[Sandy Plains]] ===
The Sandy Plains is mainly a savannah region, with a couple large desert areas. As a savannah, the locale has light vegetation. There is also an area with a mud pit. In the distance of some areas, a giant tree can be seen, though it cannot be visited. The edge of the area has some desert environments. Ruins are dotted throughout the plains.

The area returns in [[Monster Hunter Rise]]. It is largely the same, though some areas have received some changes, and some new areas have been added, such as a second muddy area. The giant tree is less prominent, however the ruins in this locale have become more prominent.

In the third generation, Areas 8, 9, and 10 require cool drinks during the day, and hot drinks during the night.
