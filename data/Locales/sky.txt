{{NavigationHabitats}}

Skies are high altitude regions consisting of vast open scapes that certain monsters fly though, while some even live in them and in nearby mountains/towers that pierce through the clouds. They are a more fringe classification, as not many locales classify as them, but still depicts whether a monster dwells in them.

==[[Fourth Generation]]==
===[[Ruined Pinnacle]]===
The Ruined Pinnacle is a mountain abundant in plantlife, containing ancient ruins, some of which are even underwater. The locale has many caves and impressive waterfalls. Its most distinct feature is the giant tower brimming with dragon energy found at its peak, which stretches far above the clouds, and is the home of [[Valstrax]].

==[[Third Generation]]==
===[[Sacred Pinnacle]]===
A mountaintop near [[Yukumo]], this serves as the arena to fight Amatsu in the third and fourth generation. It has some grass and trees. The sky is perpetually red, even if Amatsu isn't in the area, but the sky clears up after Amatsu's death. In [[Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate]], a number of deviants can also be fought here, such as [[Redhelm Arzuros]].

==[[Frontier Generation]]==
===[[Large Exploration Ship]]===
A very large transportation ship created by the [[Guild]], in order to explore though skies and to map out large ruined towers. Some monsters living in and flying through the skies will barge in and land on the ship, which functions like a special locale/arena.
