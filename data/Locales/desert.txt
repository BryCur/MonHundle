{{NavigationHabitats}}Deserts are barren, harsh environments, featuring little vegetation. Deserts are generally very dry, but commonly feature oases, water caves or muddy areas. Other common features are dunes and caves. Due to their barren, dry nature, desert locales have little overlap with other types of locales, aside from savannahs. Prior to the [[Fifth Generation]], deserts required [[Cool Drink|Cool Drinks]] during the day, and [[Hot Drink|Hot Drinks]] during the night.

== [[Sixth Generation]] ==

=== [[Windward Plains]] ===
A vast locale that is both desert and savanna. The locale contains two gigantic open areas, one featuring a savanna environment with yellow grass and trees that has a river flowing through; the other area is a barren stretch of sand dunes. Between the two areas are a number of smaller cave-like zones. The locale also has a giant ring-like structure, and many pillar-like structures that function as lightning rods. Inside of the Windward Plains lies the village of [[Kunafa]], which produces cheese and works with [[Seikret|Seikrets]].

During the Fallow period, the area features a desaturated color palette and yellowed, dehydrated flora. During the Inclemency period, a giant thundering sandstorm sweeps across the area, during which the apex [[Rey Dau]] becomes active. The plains are buffeted by sand and constant lightning strikes. The giant ring-like structure also lights up due to the ore around its base. During the Plenty period, color returns to the plains as the area becomes vibrant and lush.

== [[Fifth Generation]] ==

=== [[Wildspire Waste]] ===
The Wildspire Waste features both sandy desert environments and a small forested area. The locale's trademark is the titular wildspire, a gigantic anthill towering over the dune section. Water from the [[Ancient Forest]] collects and gathers in the Waste's more humid areas. A gate leading to [[Astera]] can be found in the southeast.

== [[Fourth Generation]] ==

=== [[Dunes]] ===
The Dunes is an updated version of the Old Desert from the first generation with a few key differences. This area is barren and filled with much sand. There is a large lake in the middle of the area, which can be seen from a couple of areas. At night, a pathway appears on this lake, allowing faster movement between areas. Unlike its first generation counterpart, the Dunes does not contain a water cave.

This area requires cool drinks during the day, and hot drinks during the night.

=== [[Forlorn Citadel]] ===
The Forlorn Citadel only contains a single area aside from the base camp and is only inhabited by [[Ahtal-Ka]]. The area is the ruins of a large fortress. As the hunt progresses, the walls of the citadel become covered in silk. After Ahtal-Ka is slain, the ruins come crumbling down to reveal a vast, open desert.

== [[Third Generation]] ==

=== [[Sandy Plains]] ===
The Sandy Plains is mainly a savannah region, with a couple large desert areas. As a savannah, the locale has light vegetation. There is also an area with a mud pit. In the distance of some areas, a giant tree can be seen, though it cannot be visited. The edge of the area has some desert environments. Ruins are dotted throughout the plains.

The area returns in [[Monster Hunter Rise]]. It is largely the same, though some areas have received some changes, and some new areas have been added, such as a second muddy area. The giant tree is less prominent, however the ruins in this locale have become more prominent.

In the third generation, Areas 8, 9, and 10 require cool drinks during the day, and hot drinks during the night.

== [[Second Generation]] ==

=== [[Desert]] ===
The Desert is very similar to the Old Desert from the first generation, containing many of the same types of environments, such as large open sandy areas, more canyon-like areas and a giant water cave.

During the day, this area requires cool drinks, and hot drinks at night.

== [[First Generation]] ==

=== [[Old Desert]] ===
The Old Desert, simply known as the Desert in the first generation, is a simple desert locale, with large sandy zones, many palm trees, and some canyon-like areas. Notably, this locale has a very large water cave.

Cool drinks are required during the day, and hot drinks during the night.
