{{NavigationHabitats}}

Jungles are dense, tropical forests, and are a common sight throughout the Monster Hunter series. Jungles frequently overlap with Forests due to the two environments being quite similar.<!-- Not really happy with the above description, it ends too abruptly. if anyone sees this before I get back to it, feel free to change the above description. -->

== [[Sixth Generation]] ==

=== [[Scarlet Forest]] ===
The Scarlet forest is a tropical forest filled with ruins of what appears to be an ancient city. It is located near the Windward Plains. It gets its name from its fallow period, wherein the water in the forest gains a red color. During the inclemency, heavy rain pours down, causing streams to flow rapidly, hindering movement for hunters. The apex [[Uth Duna]] becomes active during this time. During the plenty, the water turns a bright blue color, and the flora in the area becomes much more vibrant as well. A [[Lynian]] tribe known as the [[Wudwud]] resides in this locale.

== [[Fifth Generation]] ==

=== [[Ancient Forest]] ===
The Ancient Forest is rife with dense and lush flora that surround the titanic Ancient Tree, bordered by the coast of the [[New World]]. The forest experiences frequent precipitation and could be considered a rainforest. Water from the Ancient Forest flows into the [[Wildspire Waste]]. The settlement of [[Astera]] is directly connected to the Ancient Forest.

== [[Fourth Generation]] ==

=== [[Primal Forest]] ===
The Primal Forest is a tropical area featuring impressive grottoes and vibrant flora. The region is filled with many gigantic skeletons across many of its areas. Its vibrant forests are contrasted by area 8, a barren and dreary mountain with the skeleton of a gigantic monster that overlooks much of the landscape.

== [[Third Generation]] ==

=== [[Flooded Forest]] ===
The Flooded Forest is a thick forested wetland, featuring both elements of jungles and swamps. Much of the terrain here is covered in puddles and deep lakes. An ancient structure, seemingly a temple, rises from the far reaches of the locale. In [[Monster Hunter 3]] and [[Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate|3 Ultimate]], several areas are flooded, allowing hunters to swim in them. However, as this mechanic isn't present in other games, these areas are instead shallow in [[Monster Hunter Portable 3rd]] and [[Monster Hunter Rise|Rise]].

== [[Second Generation]] ==

=== [[Jungle]] ===
The Jungle is a seaside tropical forest with dense foliage. Some areas have many thin trees that make it difficult to see prior to the fifth generation. The area also contains multiple large caves, as well as some small ones. Nighttime in this region sees heavy rainfall. Past the beach are the ancient ruins of what appears to be a temple, similar to the one found in the Flooded Forest. In [[Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak]], this temple leads to an underground platform.

=== [[Great Forest]] ===
The Great Forest is a largely unexplored region consisting of giant trees and crystal clear lakes and rivers. A gigantic hollow tree sits near the center, which many monsters use for nesting. 

== [[First Generation]] ==

=== [[Old Jungle]] ===
The Old Jungle is dense with foliage that can be hard to see through, and is littered with ancient ruins. There's also multiple areas on the side of a river, as well as multiple large waterfalls. One area appears to be a giant hollow tree or a mass of large trees, with waterfalls and the floor covered in shallow water. This connects to some caves with fast flowing water. One area is on a hill above the trees.
